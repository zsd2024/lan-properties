**LAN Properties** enhances the vanilla "Open to LAN" interface to provide full control over all server settings, just like in server.properties on a dedicated server.

## What is LAN Properties?

LAN Properties is a mod that gives you access to all server.properties settings when opening your world to LAN, just like on a dedicated server.

## How do I use it?

Simply install the mod and click "Open to LAN" as normal. There will be a configuration button that lets you customize all server settings.

### Hybrid Mode

LAN Properties introduces an additional property called **`hybrid-mode`**.

When `online-mode` is disabled but `hybrid-mode` is enabled, the server attempts to authenticate players in a "best of both worlds" approach:

- **If an account with the player’s username exists** → The server fetches the official UUID from Mojang’s session servers.
- **If the session servers are unreachable or the username does not belong to a valid account** → The server falls back to using an offline UUID.

This ensures that premium (online) players always keep their correct UUID, while still allowing offline players to join when needed.
